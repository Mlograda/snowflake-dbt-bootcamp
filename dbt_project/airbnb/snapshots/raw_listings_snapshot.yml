      hard_deletes: invalidate # "invalidate" means when a record is deleted, you want to take a look at
      # the snapshot records and update the end columns so that you see that the life cycle of this 
      # column has been completed , if "new_record" is used then the snapshot table would have an extra column  which
      # is called db_is_deleted , and when an original record is deleted, that flag wil be flipped to true


# what is there is no change in the data but someone deletes a record from the data , how can the snapshot 
# engine pick up this change? --> use configuration variabel for that called hard_delectes
